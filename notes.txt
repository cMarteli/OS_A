STEPS

SORT ARRAY BY A.T

ONCE LOADED CREATE A PRIORITY QUEUE (CALLED READY QUEUE) WITH ALL PROCESSES WITH A.T = 0

HAVE METHOD FOR CLOCK TICK THAT:
-CHECKS THE INPUT ARRAY FOR ANY ARRIVING PROCESSES -> ADDS THEM TO READY QUEUE 
-ALSO subtracts BURST TIME FROM ACTIVE PROCESS
no need to sort list is using priority queue also arrival time is only used when first pushing to queue so it's in the heap it means it has already arrived

HAVE PROCESS METHOD THAT PRINTS THE LETTER OF RUNNING PROCESS AND SUBTRACTS FROM BURST TIME EVERY CLOCK TICK

IF A NEW PROCESS REACHES A.T CHECK IT PRIO IS HIGHER IF NOT LEAVE IT IN QUEUE

ONCE WE REACH END OF ARRAY STOP LOADING NEW PROCESSES INTO QUEUE
